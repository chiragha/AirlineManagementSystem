This project on the Airline Management System is the automation of the registration process of the airline system. The system provides information like passenger information, flight information, and a list of all passengers, it allows for storing and retrieving data related to the airline industry and make transactions related to air travel etc. The system also allows us to add records when passengers reserve tickets. For data storage and retrieval we use MySQL Database. It enables us to add any number of records in our database.
